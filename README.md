### Hi there 👋

My Website: https://www.techkushx.com

👋 Hi there! I'm Namesh Kushantha, a Flutter mobile app developer with a deep interest in computer science and education. 

📱 I love building beautiful and functional mobile applications using Flutter, and I'm constantly learning new techniques and technologies to improve my skills. 

👨‍🏫 As a teacher at heart, I also enjoy sharing my knowledge with others and helping them to learn and grow. Whether it's through blog posts, online tutorials, or one-on-one mentoring, I'm always looking for ways to give back to the community and inspire others to pursue their passion for technology.

🧠 In addition to my work as a developer and educator, I'm also interested in exploring the frontiers of computer science, from artificial intelligence and machine learning to quantum computing and beyond. 

🚀 If you share my passion for mobile app development, computer science, and education, I'd love to connect with you! Feel free to check out my GitHub repositories, follow me on Instagram, or drop me a line at techkush2017@gmail.com. Let's build something great together!
